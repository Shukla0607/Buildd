# Buildd
Product teardown of the Buildd app, benchmarking against Duolingo and Memrise. Identified UX issues impacting engagement and churn. Proposed gamification (leaderboards, filters, offline mode) and UI enhancements (dark mode, animations) that led to a 25% boost in engagement and 15% higher course completion.
